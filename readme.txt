Visual Recipe Index - Plugin to create an automatically updating recipe index with pictures.

== Description ==

This plugin creates an automatically updating recipe index with pictures.
It uses the recipes that you already have on your blog, and the categories that you have defined.

To use, follow the instructions on the admin page (Settings->Visual Recipe Index) to generate shortcodes to paste onto a page of your choice to display your recipe index.

This plugin requires that a featured image be set for the thumbnail images to work properly.

If you create a visual recipe index and don't see images for some of your recipes you should check to make sure you have the featured image set.

== Installation ==

You can download and install Visual Recipe Index using the built in WordPress plugin installer. If you download Visual Recipe Index manually, make sure it is uploaded to "/wp-content/plugins/buddypress/".

Activate Visual Recipe Index in the "Plugins" admin panel using the "Activate" link.

You can now create your recipe index via the instructions on the Settings->Visual Recipe Index page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q: Can I style this with css?
A: Yes, everything should be fully styleable.  If you find something that isn't please contact the developer via the support forums and I'll see what I can do.
