Visual Recipe Index - Plugin to create an automatically updating recipe index with pictures.

== Description ==

* [Sign up for early access and release pricing for the pro version](http://kremental.com/visual-recipe-index)

**Visual Recipe Index**
This plugin creates an automatically updating recipe index with pictures.
It uses the recipes that you already have on your blog, and the categories that you have defined.

To use, follow the instructions on the admin page (Settings->Visual Recipe Index) to generate shortcodes to paste onto a page of your choice to display your recipe index.

This plugin uses the featured image for the thumbnail if set, and the first image of the post if a featured image isn't set.

<!--This plugin requires that a featured image be set for the thumbnail images to work properly.

If you create a visual recipe index and don't see images for some of your recipes you should check to make sure you have the featured image set.-->

**Visual Recipe Index Pro - Features being considered for development**
* Simplified user interface

* Pagination/endless scroll

* Drag and drop category ordering

* Faster image loading

* Beautiful styles with several themes to choose from

* Removal of dependency on cutting and pasting shortcodes on a page

* Option to automatically add multi-page index creation with hierarchy

* Option for slider gallerys with multi-page/category hierarchys

* Significantly improved SEO

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I style this with css? =

Yes, everything should be fully styleable.  If you find something that isn't please contact the developer via the support forums and I'll see what I can do.

= How are the images resized? =

The images are resized using an embedded version of TimThumb.  It is using version 2.8.13.

= Why aren't my images showing? =

The most common reason for this is that you don't have a cache directory or the cache directory isn't writeable by the webserver.  It should be located at: your-wordpress-installation-directory/wp-content/plugins/visual-recipe-index/includes/cache.

Please ensure that this directory exists and is writeable by your webserver.
